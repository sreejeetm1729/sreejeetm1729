Hello! 🍁
I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of ECE, North Carolina State University. My current interests are in the broad aspects of Control Theory, Large Scale Machine Learning, Statistical Learning Theory, and Adversarial Reinforcement Learning. As a part of my research work, I also have relevant background in Probability Theory, Linear Algebra, Stochastic Optimization, Randomized Algorithms, and Robust Statistics. Previously, I have completed my M.Tech in Robotics and Autonomous Systems from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 2023 and B.E in Electrical Engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata in 2021. During my master’s at IISc, I actively worked on perturbative networked systems, and perceptive algorithms for swarms.

Aside from my passion for mathematics, I also enjoy cooking, reading, writing poetry, and reflecting deeply.<br/>
Also, I love cats, and elephants. A lot. 🐘❤️😸
