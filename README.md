- 👋 Hi, I’m @sreejeetm1729
- 👀 I am currently pursuing Master's in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at IISc,Bangalore.I am an ardent problem solver and an explorer who loves to work in interdisciplinary fields covering broad domains of robotics, intelligent systems, data driven control and networked intelligence. I have done/doing active research work on swarm optimization, path planning and novel image processing techniques for improving perceptions and enhancing senses. Apart from that I am also highly interested in carrying out relevant works in the field of nano-robotics and applications of quantum technologies in optimizing intelligent systems performance in multiple aspects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to implement swarms in micro and nano scales for possible applications and deeper insights in diverse fields of biology and related domains.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on works related to Swarm Robotics.
